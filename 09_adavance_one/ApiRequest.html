console.log is a debugging tool:
- It is NOT part of the JavaScript core language.
- It is provided by browser engines (like V8 in Chrome) to help developers debug.
- This is part of the Web APIs, not the JS language spec itself.

ðŸ§  JavaScript as a "Wrapper":

- JavaScript is a **high-level, interpreted language** designed to be easy for humans to write and read.
- But computers donâ€™t directly understand JavaScript; they understand **machine code** (binary instructions).

- To run JavaScript in the browser, it's passed to an engine like **V8 (Chrome)** or **SpiderMonkey (Firefox)**.
  These engines are written in **C++**, which interacts with the operating system and hardware.

- JavaScript is considered a **wrapper** because:
  1. It gives developers access to complex operations (like memory management, networking, rendering) **without** exposing the low-level details.
  2. It wraps around **system-level code** (like C++) to provide a safer and more abstracted interface.
  3. The browser exposes **Web APIs** (like DOM, Fetch, XMLHttpRequest, console) that JavaScript can use, but these APIs themselves are implemented in lower-level languages.

ðŸ§µ Real-world analogy:
- Think of JavaScript as the remote control (easy to use), and C++ as the circuit inside the TV.
  You donâ€™t need to know how electricity works â€” you press a button and magic happens â€” because JS wraps that complexity.

ðŸ”§ Example:
- When you call console.log() in JS:
    - Youâ€™re **not using pure JavaScript**.
    - Youâ€™re actually triggering a C++ method inside the browser engine that displays text in the DevTools. -->
